# TaskTracker

I had a lot of trouble with this project. Getting the information from the JSON file to poulate on the front end was quite difficult. It was also difficult attempting to get my styling to work with the JSON file as well.

Hosting my project on the server proved to be the hardest thing I had to overcome when trying to complete this project. I had to do a lot of trial and error, working with the console, and debugging to fix the error codes that were appearing.

I was also able to get my task items to pull up in postman but i was unable to get that to reflect on my front end. It will show up in my terminal, but again, I am unable to get it to load on the front end.
